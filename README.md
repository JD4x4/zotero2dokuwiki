zotero to DokuWiki export translators.
Put the .js files into your zotero translators folder.

The Page List Creator generates a list in a DokuWiki page that is a title(s) with link(s) to a unique page name that matches the unique ID of your local zotero item.

Once this list page is created and saved, switch zotero to use the MultiPage export. Export your library into a txt file. The txt file will contain all of your zotero entries in one. 

Run the split_multipage_export.py script in order to split the file above and output to your DokuWiki data folder.

Enjoy.
