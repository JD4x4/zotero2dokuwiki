zotero to DokuWiki export translators.
Put the .js files into your zotero translators folder.

The Page Creator generates a list in a DokuWiki page that is a title(s) with link(s) to a unique page name that is the ID of your local zotero item.

Once this list page is created and saved, switch zotero to use the Page Entry export, the click the DokuWiki list page link and it will look for the unique page name. 

Once you have created the page, copy the Page Entry output into the DokuWiki editor and save the page.

Enjoy.
